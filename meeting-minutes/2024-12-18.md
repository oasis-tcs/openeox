# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Red Hat use case presentation

> Will result in pull request on TC repository.

- Przemyslaw: Walks everyone through the two use cases (present in his fork of the TC repository
              at https://github.com/p-rog/openeox/tree/main/value-scenarios/contributor-scenarios/RedHat ) 
  1. Use Case 1: Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  2. Use Case 2: Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform
- All provide feedback

## 3.2 BSI use case presentation

- Thomas Schmidt presents seven scenarios on behalf of the BSI at (
  https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/tree/main/value-scenarios/contributor-scenarios/BSI )
  1. Scenario 1: Know all End-of-Life products for a specific vendor
    - As a consumer, I want to know all End-of-Life products for a specific vendor
  2. Scenario 2: Check product lifecycle state
    - As a consumer, I want to check in which lifecycle state a specific product is.
  3. Scenario 3: Compare products of different vendors
    - As a consumer, I want to compare products of different vendors to inform my 
      purchase decision from the aspect of the lifecycle state the product is in. 
      For example, there is not point in introducing a new product that is already 
      outdated or does not have support anymore. 
      Therefore, it is crucial to have a common language across all vendors.
  4. Scenario 4: Check producer compliance
    - As a consumer, I want to check whether a product that I got a list of part for
      contains any parts that have no security support as this would violate the rules
      of the contract with my producer
  5. Scenario 5: Audit compliance
    - As an regulator/auditor, I want to check whether any product used in the
      critical infrastructure has no security support or is End-of-Life
  6. Scenario 6: Track lifecycle state
    - As a consumer, I want to track the lifecycle states and end dates for
      security support and End-of-Life for all my products so that I'm able to
      plan for replacement accordingly
  7. Scenario 7: Trigger replacement notifications
    - As a consumer, I want to automatically trigger replacement notifications based
      on lifecycle states and end dates for security support and End-of-Life for all my products
- All provide feedback

## 3.3 Cisco use cases and scenarios presented

- Omar presents scenarios per pull request https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/54
  1. Standardized Communication of EOL/EOS Information (as a vendor)
  2. Streamlined Internal Processes (as a vendor)
  3. Enhanced Customer Satisfaction and Retention (as a vendor)
  5. Efficient Supply Chain Management (use case 1 as consumer of technology)
  6. Cost Management (use case 2 as consumer of technology)
- All to kindly provide feedback per comments in the PR

## 3.4 Dell use cases and scenarios

           during the January TC meeting
