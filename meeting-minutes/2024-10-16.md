# 3. Discussion

- [Using "End" word in the lifecycle definitions #38](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/38):
  - Przemyslaw presents the rationale behind the ticket
  - Kris is also in favor of using the concept of milestones eg. a start of a window is a milestone and the end is another milestone
  - Feng, Omar, and Stefan like to focus on end "markers" only
  - Feng and Omar mention scope problems with the charter
  - Stefan Hagen sees enough work to get the end "markers" right as some may depend on start of contract
  - Thomas Schmidt is open for adding the start "marker" but is sceptical if this is doable and useful - maybe add when need clearly arises
  - all continue to discuss if adding a start "marker" is useful already and if it fits the scope given by the charter
  - Thomas Schmidt identified that two other topics where mixed into the discussion ongoing:
    - whether a successors should be included
    - whether a precision indicator should be added to the "markers":  to accommodate 
      - for risky product deployments where there might be a possible future need to shorten a support range
      - for well-sold products where there might be the wish to extend the sales range
  - Omar encourages all participants to add comments to the issue and suggests for now to focus on the end of stages and maybe later come back

- [Suggested new optional field "successor" #3](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/3):
  - Thomas Schmidt shortly presents the issue
  - Stefan Arntzen and Stefan Hagen are not against an optional field but have doubts about the use
  - Stefan Hagen esp. does not expect "hard" benefit from values in that field
  - Omar is in favor as an optional field even useful to some when most may not use it
  - Shridar esp. sees that in the end of "x" announcement from a supplier there is a place to state successors
  - Kris suggests to rename as "recommended action" (or similar) instead
  - all continue to discuss
  - Shridar moves to consider an optional field in the targeted version of the specification
  - Omar objects the idea to have the name of the field unspecified
  - Stefan Hagen suggests to add more complex information (like recommended action) later to another field
  - Thomas Schmidt moves to add an optional field `successors` into the targeted version of the specification
    - Stefan Hagen seconds
    - discussion:
      - Jautau does not think the field should be optional and wants to see it as mandatory field
      - Thomas Schmidt does not see esp. in the open source world a successor as a value the supplier can or will supply
      - Kris suggests that this field could be required and have an explicit content stating that there is no successor
      - Stefan Hagen sees problems with a required field in use cases where an open source maintainer archives their
        project and states that there is no successor (because they do not know or do not care) this does not help
        consumers and may challenge the "former" supplier in unneeded ways 
      - Omar sees more need for the discussion so the motion does not yet carry
      - Stefan Hagen suggests to add comments to the ticket to foster a conclusion soon
