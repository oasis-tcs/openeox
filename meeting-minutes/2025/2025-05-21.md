## 3.2 Issues / Pull Requests

- PR [#10](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/10)
    - Thomas Schmidt presents the core schema draft.
    - Thomas mentions the fixes related to naming conventions and review the taxonomy to make sure we have consistent wording with the schema draft.
    - Thomas Schmidt reviews the core schema.
        - The core schema allows for importing of the OpenEoX standard into existing standards or formats, such as CSAF or an SBOM format, and have OpenEoX included with methods to reference the product. 
    - Thomas Schmidt reviews the shell schema.
        - The shell schema is meant to be a stand-alone version of the OpenEoX standard.
        - The shell schema defines a structure when you can have multiple OpenEoX statements consisting of a product bound to the core schema.
        - You can have multiple OpenEoX statements in the shell schema.
    - Feng, Sonny, Rogue, and Thomas discussed the importance of consistent product identification across various document types and standards and emphasized the need for a unified approach to linking documents like SBOM, CSAF, and OpenEoX.
        - Thomas strongly suggests that once we have a version of OpenEoX, we can include it into exisiting standards, such as CSAF, using the `product_identification_helper`.
        - `product_identification_helper`, similar to what is used in CSAF, will help maintain consistency across different ecosystems and perhaps we make the use of `product_identification_helper` mandatory.
        - Sonny, Thomas, and Justin all state while there is a real need to have unique product identifiers, our TC is not the right place to solve this issue, and it is out of scope of the TC charter.
    - Thomas Schmidt suggests that we refocus the discussion to move forward with making progress on the core schema draft and emphasizes the need to show the community we are making progress.
    - Stefan moves to accept the core schema draft as seen in PR [#10](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/10).
    - Rogue asks about the product_software.json and product_hardware.json.
    - Thomas explains the purpose and how they are examples of how to classify the product as software or hardware and gives several example use cases.
    - Sergii supports the idea of accepting the core schema draft.
    - Justin restates the motion from Stefan.
    - Rogue seconded. No more discussion. No objections. Motion passed.

## 3.3 Other Business

- Thomas Schmidt suggests that now that we have a core schema draft, we can take steps for a committee specification draft template and ask the TC for editors.
- Thomas Schmidt sets the motion to tasks the TC Officers to request a committee specification draft template from the OASIS Admin Staff and make all comments to make that available in our repository and request the TC for editors.
- Justin seconded. No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.

## 3.4 Next steps

- TC chairs will request a committee specification draft template from the OASIS admin staff and make necessary comments to get it into the repository.
