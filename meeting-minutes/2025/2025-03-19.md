# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 General Discussion

- Registration and Quorum Calculation
    - Thomas proposes using an open source tool that will track attendance, quorum, and voting status for TC members given the ongoing challenges with OASIS platform.
      - Received verbal permission from OASIS to use the open source tool. Awaiting for written approval.
    - Sonny asks if the OASIS Higher Logic capability to "RSVP" works for tracking attendance and quorum calculation?
        - Omar clarifies that this mechanism does not allow for tracking attendance, quorum calculation, and voting status for TC meetings.
    - Omar states that an open source tool that is contributed by an organization or individual that is going to be continued to be maintained would be welcomed by OASIS.
    - Omar mentions that Stefan and Thomas are part of the OASIS Board Technology Subcommittee currently discussing potential paths forward for OASIS.
    - Omar asks Thomas if the open source tool will be integrated with the OASIS infrastructure registration?
        - Thomas clarifies that the open source tool is not currently integrated. If the OASIS Board Technology Subcommittee decides to use the tool, they can choose to integrate it into the OASIS workflow.
        - Thomas says at this time it does not make sense to bind the tool to the OASIS infrastructure.
    - Omar mentions that not only is attendance and quorum calculation/voting status a problem, but also the roster and current status of participation of members/organizations with the TCs.
    - Thomas suggests using the tool as an interim solution to track attendance, quorum, voting status independently for the time being.
    - Justin confirms support for Thomas' suggestion re: the open source tool for quorum calculation.
- In Person Meeting
    - Thomas suggest having an in person meeting to help make more significant progress with the OpenEoX standard.
    - Omar suggests RSA as a possible venue for an in person meeting.
    - Thomas and Justin discuss inability to travel to RSA due to administration transition and budgeting changes. Thomas suggests VulnCon as a possible alternative.
    - Justin also suggests VulnCon and supports the idea of an in person meeting, but suggests to make it a hybrid meeting to allow optimized participation from the TC.
    - Sonny, Rogue, Feng, Thomas, Omar, and Justin all confirm in person participation at VulnCon in Raleigh, NC.
    - Omar suggests meeting at Cisco RTP offices and offers to host the in person meeting instead of meeting at the McKimmon Center (venue for VulnCon).
    - In person meeting will take place tentatively on Wednesday April 9th at 3 PM Eastern Time at Cisco RTP office.
        - Thomas suggests we meet Wednesday and Thursday. Omar agrees.
- Other External Efforts re: End-of-Life
    - Omar highlights the value and importance of an in person meeting in making progress as there are other external efforts starting to make progress in the area of end-of-life/end-of-support that may add pressure to OpenEoX.
    - Denny empasizes the need to move quick.
    - Shridhar states that while we need to operationalize the effort, we also need to make the standard robust, and that he is not a fan of moving too quickly and possibly missing something.
    - Rogue suggests that this group should define a minimum standard to use as a starting point and extend it and add new features based on the requirements.
    - Thomas mentions the Ecma TC54 TG3 CLE standard (Issue [#71](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/71)) and confirms that we are not the only effort.
    - Thomas further explains his belief that we have two solid definitions with End-of-Life and End-of-Sales.
    - Thomas suggests that we start with these two strong definitions because people can use them and we can produce a standard specification from these as a starting point that we can then build out.
        - Thomas believes we can produce a specification quickly and have a standard in a possible two month timeframe.
        - Once we put out the standard, we can then circle back and discuss more use cases, more definitions, etc. 
    - Omar supports this suggestion and mentions that we cannot control the timelines of the other efforts, but we can accelerate our own process.
    - Omar suggests that this does not necessarily need to be a schema, but could be a position paper and that this would increase the chances that the other efforts will align with OpenEoX.
    - Rogue supports the need to move quickly on a starting point and address the main problem of needing to have a standardized method for the community/ecostem to approach End-of-Life, instead of having competing efforts that lead to everyone having separate methods of doing it.
    - Omar puts a motion in place that we prioritize the taxonomy and definitions and defining phase 1 minimum element that an OpenEoX record should have and publish this in the form of a whitepaper within a two month timeframe of todays meeting (2025-03-19).
    - Denny, Rogue, and Justin seconded. No objections. Motion passed.
    - Sonny asks where would this whitepaper would be published?
    - Omar responds that we could have both an OASIS blog post and possibly doing a press release.
    - Denny highlights the importance to show some progress to the community.
    - Thomas suggests we meet Wednedsay and Thursday.
