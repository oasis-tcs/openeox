# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Updates
- Omar gave an update on the pending items related to acronyms.
- Omar checked with OASIS, other TCs, and ISO standard contacts regarding acronyms and the important aspect is consistency throughout the standard.
- Omar gave an update that OASIS staff has a template where we can put the content of the draft of the whitepaper.
    - The process is: Once we have the definitions in place and paper finalized, there will be a ballot for the paper to be approved as a work item for the TC.
    - With majory vote, the paper will proceed to be published.
    - Omar will take the action item to convert current state of whitepaper to the OASIS template.

    - Langley asks the opportunity to take a deeper look before setting a motion.
    - Rogue and Thomas Schmidt discuss how to handle the case of End-of-Security-Support without End-of-Life. Rogue asks if the TCs approach is the correct approach for the open source community?
- Thomas responds that it is probably a good idea to require that field not only to make people think about what is their End-of-Security-Support, but also to help people downstream to know if there is security support not.
    - Stefan supports Langley's suggestion to have time to take a deeper look at the core schema.
    - Sergii asks about the timestamp enum "tba".
    - Thomas Schmidt clarifies that if you don't have the timestamp right now, that "tba" allows for the issuer to provide the timestamp information later.
