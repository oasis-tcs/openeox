# 3. Discussion

## 3.3 Issues / Pull Requests

- Thomas: Walks all through [Single fields vs. scope for End of Maintenance #67](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/67)
- All discuss
- Langley: Concerns on too many facets requiring teimestamps as a problem for producers
- Thomas: These detailed category entries are optional
- Langlkey: Why not let the organizations choose
- Art: Maybe also a burden on consumers (when the manifold of categroies is offered) on how 
  to create policies against such a large set
- Stefan: Enumeration for categories seems important to fulfill our charter and constraining 
  excessive use of such categories making it difficult for producers and consumers alike can
  only be stated as SHOULD or lower level maybe even simply informative text. 
- Thomas: Shares the conviction that the categories should be enumerations for automation 
  and clarity; also they are optional
- Langley: Maybe look if we can match a subset of categories to the existing contributed use cases
- Feng: Yes, we need to identify the common cases

- Thomas: suggests to close [Information Model example #24](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/pull/24) with no action
- No objections, PR closed without action.

- Thomas: No further action required for [Whither the EoX schema? #64](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/64)
- Thomas: Will encourage the reporter to ask for closing themselves
- Stefan: Will label as question

- Thomas: Opened issue [Common denominators of use cases #68](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/68) for everyone to use in
