# 3. Discussion

## 3.1 Updates

- Omar shared an update about the discussion centered around collaboration with the Ecma Software and system transparency - Common Lifecycle Enumeration (TC54-TG3) working group. This was a follow-up from the discussion in the issue created by Omar on the ECMA TC 54 GitHub repository: [https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg3/issues/4](https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg3/issues/4)
  - Participants emphasized the need for alignment and coordination between efforts.
  - The group agreed to have dedicated representatives for ongoing communication. The team discussed that Rogue could be that representative from OpenEoX.
  - We will continue our work as planned and have touch points with CLE working group for alignment on the taxonomy. Their scope is a lot broader than OpenEoX.

## 3.2 Issues / Pull Requests

- Three separate specifications (core, shell, API) will be developed independently.
- Editors will be responsible for managing contributions and ensuring document alignment.
- Volunteers for editor roles were confirmed to facilitate the specification process:
  - Jay White
  - Stefan Hagen
  - Thomas Schmidt
- Omar Santos moved to accept the nomination of the editors.
  - Justin seconded.
  - No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Stefan Hagen moved to allow the editors to provide the list of new editors to the OASIS staff.
  - Justin seconded.
  - No discussion. No objections. Motion passed.
- Thomas emphasized the importance of clear initial descriptions for targeted feedback on technical comments.
- The discussion highlighted the need for clarity around end-of-life and security support dates to assist users.
- Concerns arose about using "TBD" in schemas, as it may lead to confusion and hinder effective data communication.
- We discussed the proposal of [issue #92](https://github.com/oasis-tcs/openeox/issues/92).
  - This proposal is to provide core.json more flexible for being referenced and used in different scenarios. "required" will cover more simple scenarios.
  - This would involve using an "anyOf" construct with multiple "required" options, allowing for different combinations of fields like "end_of_life," "end_of_security_support," and "last_update" to be considered mandatory.
  - There has been no definitive outcome or resolution yet. However, a call to action to continue the conversation in GitHub was made by Omar.
