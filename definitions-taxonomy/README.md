# OpenEoX Life Cycle Definitions & Taxonomy

This section provides a high-level overview of the OpenEoX life cycle definitions and taxonomy. It is intended to provide a common understanding of the terms used in the OpenEoX project and to facilitate communication between the different stakeholders.

All definitions are originally being developed by the TC via GitHub issues. After the TC has agreed on a definition, it will be added to this OpenEoX section and eventually to the glossary of the OpenEoX specification.
