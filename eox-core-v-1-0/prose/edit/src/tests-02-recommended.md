## Recommended Tests

Recommended tests SHOULD NOT fail at a valid OpenEoX Core Information without a good reason.
Failing such a test does not make the OpenEoX Core Information invalid.
These tests may include information about features which are still supported but expected to be deprecated in a future version of OpenEoX.
A program MUST handle a test failure as a warning.
