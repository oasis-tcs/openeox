# Taxonomy

The following subsections describe the taxonomy defining and explaining all terms the standard is build upon.

## End-of-Life

The End-of-Life (EoL) indicates the last day when the particular product (or the product version/release) is officially
supported in any way by the vendor.
After this date there shouldn’t be more development, updates or any type of support expected from the vendor.
The existing customers are also impacted by this product lifecycle stage and should consider migration to the
still supported product version or release.

## End-of-Sales

The End-of-Sales (EoS) indicates the last day when a particular product (or the product version/release) may be ordered
by customers from vendor sales channels.
After this date, the product is no longer for sale.
However, there might be other sources where the product is still available.
Once the product reaches the EoS lifecycle stage, it may still be supported by the vendor, based on the official or
dedicated vendor lifecycle model for this product, for existing customers.
The implications for existing customers regarding license renewals, updates, upgrades to newer versions or ongoing
technical support can vary depending on the vendor's specific policies.

## End-of-Security-Support

The End-of-Security-Support (EoSSec) indicates the last day when the vendor has committed to providing
security remediations for the particular product (or the product version/release).

## General Availability

The General Availability (GA) indicates the first day when the particular product (or the product version/release)
is officially launched and made accessible to the general public or through its intended distribution channels.

## Product

Product is any deliverable (e.g. software, hardware, specification, or service) which can be referred to with a name.
This applies regardless of the origin, the license model, or the mode of distribution of the deliverable.

## Product Lifecycle

Every product type (software, hardware, managed service and other deliverables) can be associated with a lifecycle model.
It can contain definitions of various support models (different levels of maintenance) in association to the product versioning convention.
The lifecycle support model can be dynamic and may change over time, from the product's initial release (General Availability)
to its discontinuation (End-of-Life).
During the product lifecycle, support models may switch from one state to another and may even run in parallel to meet individual requirements.
Those requirements may depend on the product type, the vendor offerings, as well as geographical related regulations.

## Vendor

Vendor refers to the community, individual, or organization that created or maintains a product (software, hardware,
managed service and other deliverables).
This includes, but is not limited to, open-source software and hardware providers.
