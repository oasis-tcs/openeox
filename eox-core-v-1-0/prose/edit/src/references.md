# References

(This annex forms an integral part of this Specification.)

This section contains the normative and informative references that are used in this document.

Normative references are specific (identified by date of publication and/or edition number or version number) and Informative references are either specific or non-specific. For specific references, only the cited version applies. For non-specific references, the latest version of the reference document (including any amendments) applies. While any hyperlinks included in this section were valid at the time of publication, OASIS cannot guarantee their long term validity.
