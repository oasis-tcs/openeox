## Construction Principles

TODO:

- add generic paragraph about OpenEoX Core
- add paragraph about JSON Schema
- optional: add paragraph about imported/references schemas (should be none here)

Even though not all - especially the referenced - JSON schemas prohibit specifically additional properties and custom keywords,
it is strongly recommended not to use them.
Suggestions for new fields or values SHOULD be made through issues in the TC's GitHub.
The JSON schemas defined in this standard do not allow the use of additional properties and custom keywords.

> The standardized fields allow for scalability across different issuing parties and dramatically reduce the human effort and
> need for dedicated parsers as well as other tools on the side of the consuming parties.

TODO:

- describe subsequent sections
