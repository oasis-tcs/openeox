# Conformance

In the only subsection of this section, the conformance targets and clauses are listed.
The clauses, matching the targets one to one, are listed in separate sub-subsections of the targets listing subsection.

Informative Comments:

> The order in which targets, and their corresponding clauses appear is somewhat arbitrary as there is
> no natural order on such diverse roles participating in the EoX exchanging ecosystem.
